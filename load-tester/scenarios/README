When writing new scenarios, you might want to consider the following:


* Keeping the network load at a minimum

For scenarios where RTP streams are established, you might want to use a
low-bitrate codec like GSM to keep the network load as low as possible.

Here's some example of bandwidth requirements for different codecs:
* GSM/8000  - 13 kbit/s
* PCMU/8000 - 64 kbit/s
* PCMA/8000 - 64 kbit/s

* Keeping the CPU load at a minimum

For scenarios where RTP streams are established, you might want to check that no
transcoding is done by asterisk.

For example, if asterisk has to playback some files, it might make sense to
transcode manually the playbacked files so that asterisk doesn't have to do
it on the fly.
